# learning_to_speak_python
I designed this course during the COVID-19 quarantine, to help a few friends who wanted to learn programming for their own trades. These people came from diverse backgrounds - law, neuroscience, economics, program management and management consulting. I thought I should make it public, with the goal to teach people how to communicate with computers using python!

There's a total of 6 lectures, along with 6 assignments. At the end there's a final exam for you to take yourself. At the end of this, you should know enough python to start coding! Curious why you should learn to code?

**FAQs**

Q) How do I run the ipynb file?

A) Create an account on colab.research.google.com. Then, When you click on the above link to see the code, it will take you the notebook on github. That has a button up top which says "open in colab". That should work!
